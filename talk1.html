  <h1>Mad Cow Disease</h1>
  <h6>bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease)</h6>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Cause</h3>
<p>The infectious agent in Mad Cow Disease is a prion, a type of misfolded protein. Prions are transmitted to humans when a human consumes a food containing the infected prions. Prions will not be killed even if the food is cooked or heat-treated. Prions cause the deterioration of the brain. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, including bovine encephalopathy, arises in animals that possess an allele that causes the contortion of normal proteins into a disease causing shape for the particular protein. Transmission occurs when a healthy individual contacts the tainted tissues. These infected proteins in the brain causes the native cellular prions to contort turn into the infectious state, which in turn causes this transformation in other healthy proteins in a "exponential cascade". </p>
  <p>The origin of prion proteins in cattles has not been fully confirmed. The leading hypothesis is that the prions originated from the disease <i>scrapie</i> in sheep, which jumped species to cattle.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
<h3>Transmission</h3>
<p>BSE can be transmitted to humans when they consume tainted meat. When transmitted to humans, Mad Cow Disease is known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions have been known to spread through air.</p>
