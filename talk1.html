<p><p>Philosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality And math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality A business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate And chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methyl acetate Why anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery Unless their only other choice were something like art history A BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve A little less than if you learned to underwater basket-weave I'd rather eat a Fowler's toad than major in biology And social psych is worse than either pysch or sociology.</p>

<h3>Success, failure and scare</h3>
<p>I was reminded last month of a tale my old professor once told me:</p>
<p>A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game, but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach.</p>
<p>The Lion alone challenged him to combat.</p>
<p>The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and said to the Lion:</p>
<p>"I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I assail thee."</p>
<p>The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear, and when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied:</p>
<p>"You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall I abide the attack of the man himself?"</p>
<p>So how does this apply to scare?</p>
<p>For the past 5 years, our team at MIT has been working on solutions involving scare.</p>
<h4>A horror movie is a movie genre.</h2>
<h4>Horror movies are usually intended to scare the viewer.</h2>
<h4>The main stories of horror movies often involve supernatural forces or characters of Burrow origin.</h2>
<h4>Horror movies are often confused with thrillers, which are similar.</h2>
<h4>Popular horror movie characters usually include monsters or even Burrows.</h2>
<p>Early horror movies often took ideas from classic literature, such as The Burrow, Dracula and The Burrow Man .</p>
<p>Can scare be solved this easily?</p>
<p>You remember the story I told? Remember the moral:</p>
<h4>Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.</h2>
<p>If we can learn that, we can solve this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
