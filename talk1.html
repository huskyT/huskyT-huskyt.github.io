  <h1>Mad Cow Disease</h1>
  <h6>bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease)</h6>
  </div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Cause</h3>
<p>The infectious agent in Mad Cow Disease is a prion, a type of misfolded protein. Prions are transmitted to humans when a human consumes a food containing the infected prions. Prions will not be killed even if the food is cooked or heat-treated. Prions cause the deterioration of the brain. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, including bovine encephalopathy, arises in animals that possess an allele that causes the contortion of normal proteins into a disease causing shape for the particular protein. Transmission occurs when a healthy individual contacts the tainted tissues. These infected proteins in the brain causes the native cellular prions to contort turn into the infectious state, which in turn causes this transformation in other healthy proteins in a "exponential cascade". </p>
  <p>The origin of prion proteins in cattles has not been fully confirmed. The leading hypothesis is that the prions originated from the disease <i>scrapie</i> in sheep, which jumped species to cattle.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
<h3>Transmission</h3>
<p>BSE can be transmitted to humans when they consume tainted meat. When transmitted to humans, Mad Cow Disease is known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions have been known to spread through air. The transimission of Mad Cow Disease to humans is rare.</p>
</div>
  <br>
  <div>
<h3>Host Response</h3>
<p>Mad Cow Disease is caused by prions, which are misfolded proteins. These prions are technically "non-foreign", and caused by the misfolded prions which have the catalytic capability to cause this misfolding in other proteins. Additionally, this misfolding occurs in the brain, which is the immune restricted organ.</p>
</div>
  <br>
  <div>
<h3>Major Symptoms</h3>
<p>In cattle, symptoms are not immediately seen due to the disease's extremely long incubation period. Some cattle have been observed to have changes in behavior, including hyper-responsiveness to certain stimuli, as well as tremors. Behavioral changes include persistent pacing, rubbing or licking.</p>
    <p>Some nonspecific symptoms have been noted, including a loss of weight, decrease in milk production as well as lameness.</p>
    <p>Hindlimb ataxia affects the animal's movements and occurs when muscle control is lost. This results in poor balance and coordination, and eventually lose the ability to stand.</p>
    <p>Eventually, it leads to coma and death due to deterioration of the brain.</p>
</div>
  <br>
  <div>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>There is no currently known cure for mad cow disease. Certain symptoms can be managed, such as twitching; but otherwise, treatment is palliative care.</p>
</div>
  <br>
  <div>
<h3>Prevention and Control</h3>
<p>A ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle has resulted in a strong reduction in cases in countries where the disease was present. In disease free countries, control relies on import control, feeding regulations and surveillance measures.</p>
    <p>In UK and US slaughterhouses, certain organs of cattle are classified as specifed risk materials, and must be disposed of appropriately. These materials include the brain, spinal cord, intestines, eyes and tonsils from cattle.</p>
    <p>BSE-related ban has been put in effect in the US and Canada to help prevent elimination of BSE.</p>
