<h3>What I learned from spam</h3>
<p>You'll like this.</p>
<p>A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to change her into the form of a woman.</p>
<p>Venus consented to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride.</p>
<p>While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.</p>
<p>Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape.</p>
<p>But what if we could turn this same approach to spam?</p>
<p>In 2003 we set up a new team to research solutions for spam.</p>
<h4>Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person.</h4>
<h4>Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted "junk mail" that arrives in a mailbox, such as advertising pamphlets and brochures.</h4>
<h4>Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender.</h4>
<p>Is this the future of spam?</p>
<p>You remember the story I told? Remember the moral:</p>
<h4>Nature exceeds nurture.</h4>
<p>It's that simple.</p>
<p>I thank you.</p></div>
